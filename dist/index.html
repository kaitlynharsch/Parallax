  <section id="about">
    <h1> Welcome to Boulder, CO.
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h2> Boulder is a perfect balance of urban and outdoors. Known for its stellar food scene, breweries, an always-exciting downtown and more outdoor activities than you can count, the city is just 30 minutes northwest of Denver, where the Rocky
      Mountains meet the plains.
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Things to Do</h3>
    <p>See the Flatirons glow in the sunshine or dusted in snow like a powdered-sugar donut, shop on hip and historic Pearl Street, grab your boots and hit a hiking trail, or try raved-about cuisine from one of the city's chef-led eateries. Bike, ski
      or swim by morning, visit a muscle-melting spa by afternoon, then enjoy a concert and cocktails by night. With the great outdoors always steps away — yet urban adventure right out your hotel door, too — you'll find an endless variety of things
      to do in Boulder, Colorado, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Food & Drink</h3>
    <p>You can’t really know Boulder until you’ve tasted its dining scene. Named a top foodie city in America — with cultured chefs in its kitchens, mad-scientist brewers on tap, and bountiful farmland at its doorstep — there’s always something fresh
      to try. Good food is the essential fuel for Boulder’s active lifestyle.</p>
    <br>

    <h3> Boulder Nightlife
    </h3>
    <p>Work hard, workout hard, then play even harder. That seems to be the credo of so many locals who help keep the after-dark scene in Boulder thriving, with places to indulge, relax and unwind. Boulder's exploding craft brewing scene means
      tasting rooms are located all over town, plus these two areas are always happening:</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Pearl Street</h3>
    <p>This brick-paved pedestrian walkway is the heartbeat of Boulder, and it's no different at night. Bars and restaurants line the street and fan out into the surrounding blocks. Try a cozy craft brewpub, sip prohibition-era cocktails or find
      dive-y joints tucked underground — it's all here, plus local and big-name musical acts at the historic Boulder Theater. Just off Pearl Street is the new Rosetta Hall, an innovative food hall by day and dance club by night (Thurs–Sat). And
      nearby is Supermountains, an Asian-influenced eatery that turns into a nightclub after dark on Fridays and Saturdays. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Hill</h3>
    <p>The Hill is located next to the University of Colorado campus and consequently has a boisterous, student-centric nightlife scene, which includes the Fox Theatre, a legendary music venue that was called one of the country's best by Rolling
      Stone.</p>
